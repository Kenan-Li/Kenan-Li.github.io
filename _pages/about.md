My research centers on the intersection of spatial computation, environmental health, and community resilience. I specialize in utilizing big data, deep learning, and GIS to develop geo-AI frameworks, integrated geo-cyber-infrastructures, and biostatistics algorithms for analyzing integrated sensor data. I see myself as a researcher who bridges the gap between machine learning, data mining, and interdisciplinary fields such as environmental health, human-environmental systems, and biostatistics.

From 2009 to 2015, I honed my research skills at <a href="https://www.rsgis.envs.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">Remote Sensing and GIS Lab</a> at Louisiana State University's Department of Environmental Sciences. I wrote my <a href="https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/gradschool_theses/390/" target="_blank"> masterâ€™s thesis </a> (2011) and <a href="https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/gradschool_dissertations/817/" target="_blank"> Ph.D. dissertation </a> (2015) in this lab, both focused on innovative solutions and models for various projects. After earning my Ph.D., I briefly worked as a data scientist at a startup company in Los Angeles where I gained practical experience in big data technologies such as HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, and TensorFlow and Spark.

In 2017, I took on a postdoctoral research associate role at USC's Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, where I was part of <a href="https://www.prisms-study.org/" target="_blank"> an NIH/NIBIB-funded project </a> that used machine learning, big data, and spatial analysis to study environmental health. In 2019, I joined the Spatial Sciences Institute at USC as a research scientist and secured funding from various sponsors including the NSF, NIH, Southern California Environmental Health Sciences Center, USC Keck School of Medicine, US Army Corps of Engineers and Defense Imagery Management Operations Center, and Los Angeles County.

In August 2022, I joined Saint Louis University as an assistant professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. My research interests here encompass spatial data analysis, population health, urban infrastructure and planning, and human-nature interactions. Through my time at SLU, I have developed my expertise in both teaching and research and built a strong record of funding and publications.

Besides of my academic interests, I also love sports. I am an active swimmer in the <a href="https://www.usms.org/people/0A1EY" target="_blank">U.S. Masters Swimming community</a>.
