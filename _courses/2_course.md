This is a required course for the traditional biostatistics concentration of the M.S. program in Biostatistics and Health Analytics.  It is also an elective for the M.P.H. program and the geospatial concentration of the M.S program. In this course, students will learn the fundamental concepts and techniques of statistical learning algorithms. They will gain an in-depth understanding of essential methods such as `linear regression`, `logistic regression`, and `linear discriminant analysis`, as well as learn how to evaluate and validate models using `cross-validation` and `bootstrapping` techniques. Additionally, students will acquire skills in model selection, including advanced techniques such as `ridge regression` and the `LASSO`. The course also covers nonlinear models, tree-based methods, and `support vector machines`, along with unsupervised learning methods such as `principal components` and `k-means clustering`. By working with real-world examples and hands-on exercises using the R programming language, students will gain practical experience to develop accurate and reliable statistical learning models.
