## Introduction

Spatial interpolation techniques are used to estimate the values of variables at unsampled locations based on the values of the same variable at sampled locations. One of the popular spatial interpolation techniques used in geostatistics is Kriging interpolation. Kriging interpolation is a powerful statistical method that allows one to predict the values of variables at unsampled locations while also accounting for spatial autocorrelation.

In this tutorial, we will go through the basic concepts of Kriging interpolation, the types of Kriging, and how to implement the method in R using the `gstat` library.

### Basic Concepts

Kriging is based on the assumption that the spatial correlation between observations decreases with distance, and that this correlation can be modeled using a mathematical function.

The basic idea of kriging is to find a set of weights that can be used to combine the observed values at nearby locations to estimate the value at the target location. The weights are chosen to minimize the variance of the estimation error, subject to the constraint that the estimated value is a linear combination of the observed values.

The Kriging estimator can be written as:

$$
Z^*(s_0)=\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(s_i)
$$

where $Z^*(s_0)$ is the estimated value at the target location s, $Z(s_i)$ is the observed value at location i, $\lambda_i$ is the weight assigned to the observed value at location i, and $n$ is the number of observed locations.

The weights are typically chosen to minimize the estimation variance $\sigma^2$, which is given by:

$$
min\ \ \ \sigma^2 = E \left[ Z^*(s_0)-\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(s_i) \right]
$$

The weights $\lambda_i$ are chosen to minimize the estimation variance subject to the constraint that they sum to one:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i = 1
$$

### Semivariogram

A semivariogram is a measurement used in geostatistics to analyze spatial variability of a phenomenon across a study area. It can be estimated by a plot of the semi-variance between pairs of data points against their spatial separation or lag distance.

For points $s_i$ and $s_j$, the squared differnece  and then calculate the average of these differences. This average difference is known as the semivariance for that pair of points.

We then plot the semivariance values against the lag distance between the pairs of points. The lag distance is the distance between the two points being compared, and we calculate it for pairs of points at different distances apart from each other.

Some Semivariogram Functions

| Name          | Function From | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Exponential   | right-aligned | 
| Gaussian      | centered      |  
| Matérn        | $\sigma^2/Γ(ν)2^(ν-1)) (h/φ)^ν K_ν(h/\phi$      |   
| Spherical     | $\gamma(d)$   |


The resulting semivariogram plot shows the spatial structure of the data: if the semivariance values increase with lag distance, this indicates that the data is spatially correlated (i.e., similar values are found near each other), while a flat line indicates that the data is spatially random (i.e., there is no correlation between values at different locations).

Geostatisticians use the semivariogram to analyze the spatial variability of a phenomenon and to help in the estimation of the values of the variable at unsampled locations, a process known as kriging. The semivariogram can also be used to determine the optimal sampling density and the spatial scale of a study area.

### Types of kriging

There are various types of kriging, including ordinary kriging, simple kriging, and universal kriging, which differ in their assumptions about the mean of the unknown variable and the spatial covariance function.

1. Ordinary kriging:

   Ordinary kriging assumes that the mean of the unknown variable is unknown and that the covariance between the variable at any two locations depends only on the distance between the locations. The kriging system of equations for ordinary kriging can be written as:

   $$
   \begin{bmatrix}C(s_1, s_1) & C(s_1, s_2) & \cdots & C(s_1, s_n) & 1\\C(s_2, s_1) & C(s_2, s_2) & \cdots & C(s_2, s_n) & 1\\\vdots & \vdots& \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\C(s_n, s_1) & C(s_n, s_2) & \cdots & C(s_n, s_n) & 1\\1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\lambda_1\\\lambda_2\\\vdots\\\lambda_n\\\mu\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}C(s_1, s)\\C(s_2, s)\\\vdots\\C(s_n, s)\\1\end{bmatrix}
   $$

   where $\mu$ is the unknown mean of the variable and the additional row and column of 1's correspond to the constraint that the weights sum to 1 and the assumption that the mean of the variable is unknown. The weights $\lambda_i$ are chosen to minimize the estimation variance subject to the constraint that they sum to one.

2. Simple kriging:

   Simple kriging assumes that the mean of the unknown variable is known and that the covariance between the variable at any two locations depends only on the distance between the locations. The kriging system of equations for simple kriging can be written as:

   $$
   \begin{bmatrix}C(s_1, s_1) & C(s_1, s_2) & \cdots & C(s_1, s_n)\\C(s_2, s_1) & C(s_2, s_2) & \cdots & C(s_2, s_n)\\\vdots & \vdots& \ddots & \vdots\\C(s_n, s_1) & C(s_n, s_2) & \cdots & C(s_n, s_n)\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\lambda_1\\\lambda_2\\\vdots\\\lambda_n\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}C(s_1, s)-\mu\\C(s_2, s)-\mu\\\vdots\\C(s_n, s)-\mu\end{bmatrix}
   $$

   where $\mu$ is the known mean of the variable and the weights $\lambda$ are chosen to minimize the estimation variance subject to the constraint that they sum to one.

3. Universal kriging:

   Universal kriging assumes that the mean of the unknown variable can be modeled using a known function of the spatial coordinates, such as a linear or quadratic function. The covariance between the variable at any two locations depends on both the distance between the locations and the values of the covariate function at the locations. The universal kriging estimator at an unsampled location $s$ is given by:

   $$
   Z(s) = \mu(s) + \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i (Z(s_i) - \mu(s_i))
   $$

   where $Z(s)$ is the observed value at location $s$, $\mu(s_i)$ is the deterministic trend function at location $s_i$, $\lambda_i$ is the kriging weight associated with observation $s_i$.

   The kriging system of equations for universal kriging can be written as:

   $$
   \begin{bmatrix}
   C(s_1, s_1) & \cdots & C(s_1, s_n) & f_1(s_1) & \cdots & f_m(s_1)\\
   C(s_2, s_1) & \cdots & C(s_2, s_n) & f_1(s_2) & \cdots & f_m(s_2)\\
   \vdots      & \ddots & \vdots      & \vdots   & \ddots & \vdots  \\
   C(s_n, s_1) & \cdots & C(s_n, s_n) & f_1(s_1) & \cdots & f_m(s_1)\\
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   \lambda_1\\\lambda_2\\\vdots\\\beta_1\\\vdots\\\beta_m
   \end{bmatrix} 
   = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   C(s_1, s)-\mu(s_1)\\C(s_2, s)-\mu(s_2)\\\vdots\\C(s_n, s)-\mu(s_n)\end{bmatrix}
   $$

## Citations

The covariance function and the semivariogram are two related concepts in geostatistics, but they are not the same thing.

The covariance function describes the relationship between two spatial locations in terms of their similarity or dissimilarity. It is a mathematical function that specifies the covariance or correlation between two locations as a function of their distance or lag. The covariance function is typically used in kriging to estimate the unknown value of a variable at an unsampled location as a linear combination of the observed values at nearby locations, weighted by their covariance with the unsampled location. Common examples of covariance functions used in geostatistics include the exponential, Gaussian, and spherical models.

The semivariogram, on the other hand, is a measure of spatial dependence or autocorrelation in a variable. It is defined as half the variance of the differences between pairs of values separated by a certain lag or distance. The semivariogram is a graphical representation of the spatial structure of the variable, showing how the similarity between values decreases with increasing distance or lag. The semivariogram is often used in geostatistics to estimate the covariance function, by fitting a model to the empirical semivariogram.

In summary, while both the covariance function and semivariogram are used to describe the spatial structure of a variable, the covariance function describes the relationship between pairs of locations in terms of their similarity or dissimilarity, while the semivariogram measures the degree of spatial dependence or autocorrelation in the variable.

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>

***

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is provided within `<d-code>` tags.
An example of inline code snippets: `<d-code language="html">let x = 10;</d-code>`.
For larger blocks of code, add a `block` attribute:

<d-code block language="javascript">
  var x = 25;
  function(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
</d-code>

**Note:** `<d-code>` blocks do not look good in the dark mode.
You can always use the default code-highlight using the `highlight` liquid tag:

{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 25;
function(x) {
  return x * x;
}
{% endhighlight %}

***

## Interactive Plots

You can add interative plots using plotly + iframes :framed_picture:

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="{{ '/assets/plotly/demo.html' | relative_url }}" frameborder='0' scrolling='no' height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

The plot must be generated separately and saved into an HTML file.
To generate the plot that you see above, you can use the following code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
df = pd.read_csv(
  'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/earthquakes-23k.csv'
)
fig = px.density_mapbox(
  df,
  lat='Latitude',
  lon='Longitude',
  z='Magnitude',
  radius=10,
  center=dict(lat=0, lon=180),
  zoom=0,
  mapbox_style="stamen-terrain",
)
fig.show()
fig.write_html('assets/plotly/demo.html')
{% endhighlight %}

***

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.


Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
