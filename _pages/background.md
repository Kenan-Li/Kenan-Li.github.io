The `G`eographical `R`easoning `a`nd `P`ublic `H`ealth (`GRAPH`) Lab was founded by Dr. Kenan Li with the mission of using geospatial analysis to address a wide range of public health challenges. Geospatial reasoning refers to the process of analyzing and interpreting geographic data to gain insights into various phenomena, such as the distribution of disease, environmental factors, and human behavior. In public health, geospatial reasoning is often used to understand and address health disparities, track disease outbreaks, and inform policy decisions.

The GRAPH Lab has undertaken various projects under Dr. Li's leadership to address public health challenges and provide training and resources to public health practitioners, policymakers, and researchers on how to use geospatial analysis tools to improve public health outcomes. Specifically, the lab focuses on using geospatial analysis to address health disparities, track disease outbreaks, identify environmental hazards, support emergency response efforts, and prevent chronic diseases. 

The lab's work in health disparities involves using geospatial analysis to identify areas with higher rates of disparities, such as neighborhoods with limited access to healthcare facilities or healthy food options. This information is used to develop targeted interventions to address these disparities. In tracking disease outbreaks, the lab uses GIS to identify populations at risk of infection and allocate prevention and control measures to specific areas and populations.

The lab also identifies environmental hazards, such as air pollution or contaminated water sources, and their impact on public health. This information is used to develop policies and interventions to reduce exposure to these hazards. In supporting emergency response efforts, the lab uses Geographical Information Systems (GIS) tools and statistical learning methods to identify populations at risk, track the movement of affected populations, and allocate resources to areas where they are most needed. Moreover, the lab works on preventing chronic diseases by identifying areas with high rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes or heart disease, and developing targeted prevention and control measures.

With the support of the <a href="https://taylorgeospatial.org/" target="_blank">Taylor Geospatial Institute </a>, the GRAPH Lab is able to undertake ambitious research projects and develop new approaches of using geospatial analysis to improve public health outcomes. The lab's work is helping to advance the field of geospatial reasoning in public health and contributing to the development of innovative solutions to pressing public health challenges.
