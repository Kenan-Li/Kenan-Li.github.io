This is a required course for the geospatial concentration of the M.S. program n Biostatistics and Health Analytics.  It is also an elective for the M.P.H. program and the Traditional Biostatistics concentration of the M.S program. In this course, students will learn how to utilize R for geospatial data analysis. Students will be introduced to geospatial data structures and will learn how to plot, explore, and manage spatial data using R. Topics covered in this course include `point analysis`, `smoothed kernel density estimation`, and `kriging`. Students will also learn about `variograms` and `semi-variograms`, and how to interpret spatial autocorrelation in areal data using `Moran's I` and `Geary's G`. Additionally, students will be introduced to `Bayesian methods` and `Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)` algorithms. Finally, students will learn about spatial autoregression and how to apply these concepts in R. Through a combination of theoretical instruction and hands-on exercises, students will gain practical experience in geospatial data analysis and management using R.
