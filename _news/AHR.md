Dr. Kenan Li and Dr. Gretchen Salsich are awarded the 2023 health research grant for their proposal to improve the health outcomes of individuals with chronic knee pain conditions such as patellofemoral pain (PFP) and osteoarthritis. PFP is a common and persistent issue, particularly in women, that results in reduced physical activity and can lead to decreased quality of life.

The study proposes a novel, non-invasive, cost-effective method for collecting detailed information about 3-D hip and knee kinematics, which has traditionally only been available in laboratory settings. By modeling accelerometry data in this study, the researchers will be able to gather information about individuals' movements in their natural environments, such as at home or in the community. This can provide valuable insight into the relationship between repeated movement patterns during daily activities and PFP.

The study's significance lies in its ability to identify movement impairments in real-time and understand the relationships between movement patterns, symptoms, and physical activity in real-world settings. It aims to enable early detection of knee pain conditions, facilitate the development and implementation of targeted interventions to reduce pain and disability, and enable the monitoring of treatment efficacy and progress over time.

This study represents a critical first step in expanding the current movement assessment methodology outside the laboratory. Its success will have the potential to make significant contributions to the field of knee pain research and could lead to the development of more effective interventions and treatments for individuals suffering from PFP and other knee pain conditions.
