Dr. Kenan Li has been awarded a grant through the Scholarly Undergraduate Research Grants and Experiences (SURGE) program at Saint Louis University.

***

 This program provides opportunities for undergraduate students to work on research projects with faculty members, and Dr. Li's grant will support a project focused on analyzing urban food inequity. Students interested in working on the project can apply through <a href="https://slu.joinhandshake.com/jobs/7524409/share_preview">Handshake</a> under the SLU SURGE employer profile by submitting a resume and a statement of purpose. Dr. Li will select the students who will join his research team, offering a unique opportunity for undergraduates to gain valuable research experience and contribute to important research in the field of public health. 

 This research assistantship is hybrid (some in-person work, some remote work), with opportunity for the 2023-2024 academic year. The lead faculty is Dr. Kenan Li. All SURGE positions are part-time with a maximum of 20 hours per week. Anything over the 20 hour mark will be considered volunteer time and cannot be compensated.

This study aims to explore the linkages between human mobility and access to food, with a particular emphasis on analyzing food inequality in urban areas.
The research will gather data on human mobility from various sources to map the availability of food resources such as grocery stores and food banks. This information will be combined with demographic and socioeconomic data to gain a thorough understanding of food access and inequality in the community.
The research participants will be responsible for collecting, mapping, and analyzing data on human mobility, demographics, and socioeconomic factors, as well as the distribution of grocery stores and food banks. By using innovative statistical methods, they will examine the relationships between these variables and propose practical recommendations for policymakers and community organizations to address food inequality.
